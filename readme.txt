It is the first effort in putting something together for
my project on wireless. I would like to start building a project
that can be programmed in a chip. The project needs to have the 
following characteristics
1. Be on wireless
2. Combine 5G and beyond IEEE 802.11 ax
3. Make use of machine learning
4. Results in a product or feature, or software that can be sold easily either to end consumers (more difficult) or to companies making use of it.
5. It should change the world!
